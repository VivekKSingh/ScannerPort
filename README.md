Port Scanner
===========

Port scanner software can probe machines for open ports. Port scanners are often used by network administrators to verify the security of machines in their network. They are of interest to Internet miscreants as well, since attackers can use them to find machines to compromise simply by probing for software versions with known vulnerabilities. An example of a well known, open source port scanner is Nmap.
