Port Scanner
===========

Port scanner software can probe machines for open ports. Port scanners are often used by network administrators to verify the security of machines in their network. They are of interest to Internet miscreants as well, since attackers can use them to find machines to compromise simply by probing for software versions with known vulnerabilities. An example of a well known, open source port scanner is Nmap.

In this project you will create a basic port scanner with both IPv4 and IPv6 support that is written for network administrators interested in ensuring that machines on their network run only expected services. In addition to helping you gain experience with socket programming, this project will help you appreciate the interplay of various implementation of firewalls, transport protocols and operating systems.
